I am to express my interest in the graphic designer position. With over 4 years of experience in the design industry, I have honed my skills in various design tasks, including motion graphics and video editing. I hold a Government-certified Graphic Design Level 3 certification and have extensive experience with the Adobe Creative Suite, including Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and Premiere Pro. My previous roles at Bio-Xin Cosmeceuticals, Redgreen Technology LTD, and Image Retouching Lab have equipped me with a diverse skill set, making me well-suited to handle a wide range of design projects. I am confident that my expertise and creativity will make a valuable contribution.
